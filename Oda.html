            <p>Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series <em>One Piece</em>. With more than 523.2 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, <em>One Piece</em> is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors. The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists who changed the history of manga.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. At the age of four, he resolved to become a manga artist to avoid having to get a "real job". His biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series <em>Dragon Ball</em>. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled <em>Vicky the Viking</em>. He submitted a character named Pandaman for Yudetamago's classic wrestling manga <em>Kinnikuman</em>. Pandaman was not only used in a chapter of the manga but would later return as a recurring cameo character in Oda's own works.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work <em>Wanted!</em> and won several awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka Award. That got him into a job at the <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> magazine, where he worked as an assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu Kaitani's series <em>Suizan Police Gang</em> before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on <em>Jungle King Tar-chan</em> and <em>Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman</em>, which influenced his artistic style.</p>
            <p>At the age of 19, he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on <em>Rurouni Kenshin</em> before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. During this time, Oda drew two pirate-themed one-shot stories called <em>Romance Dawn</em>, which featured Monkey D. Luffy, who later became the protagonist of <em>One Piece</em>.</p>
            <p>In 1997, <em>One Piece</em> began serialization in <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> and has become the best-selling manga series of all time. Additionally, individual volumes of <em>One Piece</em> have broken publishing records in Japan.</p>
